ðŸ“‹ Overview
This interactive application classifies Beijing air pollution levels based on meteorological conditions and pollutant concentrations. Leveraging machine learning (LightGBM), the app provides real-time pollution predictions, comprehensive data visualizations, and detailed analytical insights into the factors affecting air quality across different regions of Beijing.



ðŸš€ Quick Start
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/beijing-air-pollution-classifier.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the application
streamlit run weather_app.py

ðŸŒŸ Features
Interactive Pollution Predictor: Input environmental parameters and receive immediate pollution level classification
Comprehensive EDA: Explore pollution patterns across geographic regions, seasons, and area types
Model Performance Analysis: Compare various machine learning models with detailed metrics
Feature Importance Visualization: Understand the key factors driving pollution classification
SHAP Analysis: Gain insights into how the model interprets different environmental variables
Correlation Heatmap: Examine relationships between pollutants and meteorological conditions
ðŸ§ª Model Selection & Performance
After evaluating multiple classification algorithms, LightGBM was selected for its superior performance.

ðŸ“Š Key Findings
Geographic Disparities: Urban areas experience approximately 25% higher pollution levels compared to rural regions
Seasonal Patterns: Winter months show dramatically elevated pollution (40% higher than summer), particularly in urban centers
Pollution Distribution: Nearly equal distribution between high (37.2%) and low (37.7%) pollution episodes, with fewer moderate (25.2%) conditions
Inverse Seasonal Relationships: While primary pollutants (SOâ‚‚, NOâ‚‚, CO) peak in winter, ozone (Oâ‚ƒ) reaches maximum levels in summer
Influential Factors: PM10 concentration, temperature-dew point difference, and SOâ‚‚ levels were identified as the strongest predictors of pollution levels


ðŸ§  Technical Approach
Data Preprocessing: Log transformations applied to highly skewed variables; categorical encoding for stations and wind directions
Feature Engineering: Created derived features like temperature-dew point difference and CO/NOâ‚‚ ratio to improve model performance
Model Training: Ensemble techniques with hyperparameter optimization via grid search
Validation Strategy: Stratified 5-fold cross-validation to ensure reliable performance across pollution categories
Implementation: Streamlit for interactive web application with Plotly for dynamic visualizations

ðŸ”® Applications & Impact
Public Health Planning: Enable targeted health advisories based on predicted pollution levels
Urban Planning: Inform development decisions by understanding spatial pollution distribution
Policy Evaluation: Assess the effectiveness of pollution control measures over time
Personal Decision Support: Help individuals make informed choices about outdoor activities
